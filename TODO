- Add a main button/menu bar to the form
- Add a 'save' button to the bar (no need to press Ctrl+S)
- Alert the user if there are pending unsaved changes on exit
- Add 'replace' options to image context menu
- Allow dragging a folder containing multiple textures to change
- Better way to show which textures have been changed (in folder, too?)
- Save a copy of the original textures list (first execution; registry?)
- Add a button to restore the textures to the original state
- Close the datafiles after 1 second of inactivity (allow playing while app is running)

FUTURE STUFF
- Use an application data folder for settings, file backups, etc.
- Install MODs from ZIPs (replace every texture in the zip file)
- Show a 'mods' form with additional information about every mod
- Reverse engineering of 'bigfile' contents
- Extract IL assemblies from EXE file, probably needed for previous step
- Alternatively: find hotspot/extra sprite info in bigfile, if present
