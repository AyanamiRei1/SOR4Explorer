- Allow dragging a folder containing multiple textures to change
- Better way to show which textures have been changed (in folder, too?)
- Close the datafiles after 1 second of inactivity (allow playing while app is running)

GAME DATA
- Show related SpriteData (tooltip?)

FUTURE STUFF
- Install MODs from ZIPs (replace every texture in the zip file)
- Show a 'mods' form with additional information about every mod
